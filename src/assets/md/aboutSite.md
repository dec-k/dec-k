**Curious about this site? Awesome!**

This website is a mobile-first design where I wanted to do something a little different than just have a
living CV. It's an expression of what I like about development: quick iteration, sure to change, looks snazzy and **fun.**
So check back everyone now and then and things may look dramatically different!

Oh the actual tech stack? Sure!

- Vite + React for the build tooling and framework.
- JoyUI as a lightly-opinionated baseline for some of the components.
- Deployment and CI managed via Vercel, like everything else.
