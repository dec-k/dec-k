**Curious about this site? Awesome!**

This website is a mobile-first design where I wanted to do something a little different than just have a
living CV. It's an expression of what I like about development: quick iteration, sure to change, looks snazzy and **fun.**
So check back every now and then and things may look a little different!

This is currently the **third** total redesign.

Oh the actual stack stack? Sure!

- **Vite + React** for the build tooling and framework.
- **JoyUI** as a lightly-opinionated baseline for some of the components.
- Deployment and CI managed via **Vercel**, like everything else.
