**Hi!** I'm Dec, a developer based in Christchurch, New Zealand.

I believe in developing practical, empathy-driven solutions
that puts User Experience first and creates maintainable solutions for developers.

Over my career I've worked on **Web**, **Mobile**, and **Backend** systems but the domain that sparks the most joy for me is **Web Development.**
Web as a domain is always changing the rules, giving you new things to learn, and new ideas to create.

Specifically, I am most skilled in the following web technologies:

- React.js
- Next.js
- Typescript + Javascript
- Node

But that's not all! Outside of web, I'm also no slouch at:

- C# + .Net
- Azure Ecosystem
- DevOps
- SQL + noSQL Databases and design
- Documentation _(Love me some good documentation)_
